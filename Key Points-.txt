2) Formula either written in active cell or in a formula bar
3) For executing the formula we press enter key
4) In excel we always use cell address not the values.

Pivot table--  To summarize the data.

Reference function-- VLOOKUP,HLOOKUP,INDEX AND MATCH
Vlookup-- Vertical lookup--Lookup(search) the data from different column.
vlookup(lookup value,table array,col index no,tre/false)

Lookup value-- A value which is given
Table array-- Complete data from where we are searching the data
col index no-- From which column we find the data
true/false-- exact/approximate match.

Rule--1) In vlookup data always in the sorted order.
2) Vlookup always lookup the data from first column
3) If we lookup exact match if found then return it otherwise error.
4) If we lookup approximate if found then return exact otherwise return just lowest value
5) We lookup always working left to right.

 Match -- Only work on single row/single column.
          Match function return the position/index.


HLOOKUP-- HORIZONTAL LOOKUP
